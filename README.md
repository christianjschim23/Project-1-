# Philadelphia Housing Market
UPenn Data Science Bootcamp Project 1 - Group 4

Our thesis analyzes real estate pricing trends in Philadelphia and four other cities of comparable size (Phoenix, San Diego, San Antonio, and Dallas) to examine the interplay of socio-economic, demographic, and geographic factors affecting the housing market, including price cuts, time to sale, and inventory. The study aims to provide valuable insights for residential real estate purchasers to inform housing market trends and provide practical recommendations.

## Goal
Our goal of the project was to investigate the relationship between various factors related to the housing market and the local economy. Our project was aimed to explore the various factors that contribute to the state of the housing market in different cities, and to understand how these factors are related to each other. This was achieved by analyzing datasets of the differnet variables that describe a current housing market state for each city and to compare them as a group to help us come to a conclusion on a decision related to housing and economic development.

### Data Analyzed

#### Demographics
  * Unemployment Rates
  * Race of Homeowners
  * Age of Homeowners
  * Education of Homeowners
  
#### Housing Market
  * Home Values per City
  * Average List Prices per City
  * Housing Sale Prices per City
  * Number of New Monthly Listings per City
  * Percentages of Homes Sold Above List Price
  * Average Number of Properties with a Price Cut per City
  * Average Number of Days to Pending per City
  
#### Statistical Evidence
  * Correlations of Days to Pending vs Number of New Properties per City
  * Statistical Analysis of Unemployment Rates vs Home Values and Sales

## Conclusion
  * After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the relevant data on the housing market state in each city, it is clear that several factors are impacting the Philadelphia market. The most significant factor is the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to an overheated housing market with homes selling at significantly higher prices than the average. Additionally, Philadelphia has consistently had higher unemployment rates and lower education levels per citizen compared to the other cities. These factors may correlate with a lower median income rate, which in turn can lead to fewer home sales. In conclusion, it may be smart for real estate developers or home buyers interested in purchasing property in the Philadelphia area to consider waiting for a few years until the overheated housing market cools off.
